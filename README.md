## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### For Dance Instructors

1. **Create a new choreography**
   - Navigate to "My Choreographies" and click "Create New"
   - Add basic details (name, style, duration)
   
2. **Add dancers**
   - Go to "Dancers" and click "Add New" or import from a CSV file
   - Assign attributes (height, experience level, etc.)
   
3. **Design formations**
   - Open your choreography and click "Add Formation"
   - Drag dancers onto the stage or use "Auto-arrange" for quick positioning
   
4. **Preview transitions**
   - Click "Preview" to see animated transitions between formations
   - Adjust timing using the timeline editor

<!-- TODO: Add a screenshot of the formation editor interface here when available -->
> **Note:** Screenshots of the formation editor interface will be added once the UI is finalized.

## üí° Common Use Cases

### Dance Competition Preparation
Organize complex formations for competitive dance teams with precision timing and positioning.

```
Example workflow:
1. Create a new "Competition" choreography
2. Import your team roster
3. Design 5-7 key formations
4. Set transition timing to match music
5. Export and share with your team
```

### Dance Education
Create clear visual guides for students to understand positioning and movement patterns.

```
Example workflow:
1. Create a "Beginner Ballet" choreography
2. Add generic dancer profiles
3. Use different colors to indicate dancer groups
4. Export PDF handouts for students
```

<!-- TODO: Add a screenshot of an example choreography here when available -->
> **Note:** Example choreography screenshots will be added as the application development progresses.

## Architecture

Dance Choreography Manager implements a modern microservices architecture built on .NET Aspire, designed for scalability, resilience, and maintainability.

### üîÑ System Overview

The architecture follows domain-driven design principles with bounded contexts represented as independent microservices. Each service maintains its own data store and communicates with other services through an event-driven messaging system.

```

### üîó Communication Patterns

The architecture implements two primary communication patterns:

1. **Synchronous Communication**: REST APIs for direct client-to-service interactions through the API Gateway
2. **Asynchronous Communication**: Event-driven messaging via RabbitMQ for inter-service communication

This hybrid approach ensures responsive user experiences while maintaining service independence and resilience.

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: .NET 8 Aspire for cloud-native service orchestration
- **Data**: PostgreSQL databases with independent schemas per service
- **AI**: ML.NET for machine learning capabilities
- **DevOps**: Docker containerization with Kubernetes orchestration
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing and metrics
- **Security**: OAuth 2.0, JWT, and HTTPS throughout the system
